Built in 1884 and arriving in New York from France in 1885 it is located on Liberty Island which is in New York harbor. People can take a ferry from Manhattan or even New Jersey to reach the island.

        <img src="images/times_square.jpg" alt="Bright lights and billboards at Times Square" />
        <p>Time Square is probably one of the more known and famous areas in New York City. Its bright colorful lights and huge electronic billboards definitely make it stand out compared to other parts of the city. It is home to many broadway theatres where a lot of popular shows and musicals are performed. The area is always busy and full of people which is part of the reason it is an exciting place to visit for many tourists and locals. When I saw it in person for the first time it did not feel real.</p>

Located on the eastern edge of Central Park in Manhattan it has a huge collection of art that covers over thousands of years of ancient artifacts, paintings, sculptures, and modern works.
